'''
1)Numbers are created by numerical literals
2)Numbers are immutable objects
3)Numbers have three subtypes
    a)Integers (negative and positive numbers without fraction part)
    b)Float    (negative and positive number with fractions part)
    c)Complex  (represented by the formula a + bJ, where a and b are floats, and J is the square root of -1 (the result of which is an imaginary number).)
